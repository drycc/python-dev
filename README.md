# drycc/python-dev

A [Python 3][] language development toolbox.

Some [Drycc Workflow][] components use this Docker image as a standard build and test environment,
but it is intended to be useful to any Python developer. Please help make drycc/python-dev better by
creating [issues][] and submitting [pull requests][].

## Image Contents

* [codecov][]: uploader for codecov.io coverage reports
* [coverage][]: measures code coverage for Python programs
* [flake8][]: modular source code linter, including pep8, pyflakes and mccabe
* [Python 3.5.2][Python 3]

## Usage

Mount your local Python code into the container to run one of the included tools or scripts.
Here's an example of running `flake8` for drycc/imagebuilder:

```console
$ docker run --rm \
   --volume `pwd`/rootfs:/workspace \
   --workdir /workspace \
   drycc/python-dev:latest \
   flake8 --show-source --config=setup.cfg .
```
